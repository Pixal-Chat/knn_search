Hello,

This is a K-Nearest Neighbour(kNN) Semantic Search Model using Elastic Search(Local) and OPENAI's "text-embedding-ada-002" text embedding model 
which uses a few news articles(news_1.csv) as input data and converts them into embeddings(embedded_1.csv) and using elastic search performs knn
search query on the data.
